	abstract = {Nonsense mutations are the underlying cause of approximately 11\% of all inherited genetic diseases1. Nonsense mutations convert a sense codon that is decoded by tRNA into a premature termination codon (PTC), resulting in an abrupt termination of translation. One strategy to suppress nonsense mutations is to use natural tRNAs with altered anticodons to base-pair to the newly emerged PTC and promote translation2–7. However, tRNA-based gene therapy has not yielded an optimal combination of clinical efficacy and safety and there is presently no treatment for individuals with nonsense mutations. Here we introduce a strategy based on altering native tRNAs into  efficient suppressor tRNAs (sup-tRNAs) by individually fine-tuning their sequence to the physico-chemical properties of the amino acid that they carry. Intravenous and intratracheal lipid nanoparticle (LNP) administration of sup-tRNA in mice restored the production of functional proteins with nonsense mutations. LNP–sup-tRNA formulations caused no discernible readthrough at endogenous native stop codons, as determined by ribosome profiling. At clinically important PTCs in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR), the sup-tRNAs re-established expression and function in cell systems and patient-derived nasal epithelia and restored airway volume homeostasis. These results provide a framework for the development of tRNA-based therapies with a high molecular safety profile and high efficacy in targeted PTC suppression.},

	abstract = {RNA engineering has immense potential to drive innovation in biotechnology and medicine. Despite its importance, a versatile platform for the automated design of functional RNA is still lacking. Here, we propose RNA family sequence generator (RfamGen), a deep generative model that designs RNA family sequences in a data-efficient manner by explicitly incorporating alignment and consensus secondary structure information. RfamGen can generate novel and functional RNA family sequences by sampling points from a semantically rich and continuous representation. We have experimentally demonstrated the versatility of RfamGen using diverse RNA families. Furthermore, we confirmed the high success rate of RfamGen in designing functional ribozymes through a quantitative massively parallel assay. Notably, RfamGen successfully generates artificial sequences with higher activity than natural sequences. Overall, RfamGen significantly improves our ability to design functional RNA and opens up new potential for generative RNA engineering in synthetic biology.},

The advancement of genetic code expansion has been benefited from the development of synthetic biology, while genetic code expansion also helps to create more synthetic biology tools. In this review, we summarize recent advances in genetic code expansion brought by synthetic biology progresses, including engineering of the translation machinery, genome-wide codon reassignment, and the biosynthesis of non-canonical amino acids. We highlight the emerging application of this technology in construction of new synthetic biology parts, circuits, chassis, and products.},
